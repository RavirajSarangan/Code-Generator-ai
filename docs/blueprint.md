- Code Display: Presents the generated code snippet in a formatted text box with syntax highlighting for improved readability.
- Prompt Input: Allows users to input prompts. Prompts should specify the desired functionality of the Python code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#24292F) for a professional look.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F1F8FF) for contrast and readability.
- Accent: Teal (#26A69A) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Monospace font for code display to maintain readability and alignment.
- Clear separation between the input prompt area and the code display area.
- Subtle loading animations while the AI generates code.
